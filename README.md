A convolutional neural network trained using PyTorch to classify eight distinct blood cell subtypes with an accuracy of 89.38%.
# **Description**

## **What it is**
A ready-to-use software capable of detecting peers connected to a magnet/torrent swarm.  
The software also includes additional features for:

- Searching for magnets across multiple sites at once  
- Tracking peers by hosting your own file  
- Viewing IP/location info of connected peers  

---

## **How it works**
- **Peer detection & hosting/tracking:**  
  Uses **qBittorrent** and **ipwhois** to detect peers and fetch geo-location/info.

- **Magnet search:**  
  Uses **Jackett** to aggregate torrent search results from multiple indexers.
